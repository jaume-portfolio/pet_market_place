Build a command-line program that reads sitter review data from a CSV and outputs a ranked list of sitters.

Calculate Profile Score from the sitter’s name and Ratings Score from stay ratings.

Compute Search Score as a weighted average of Profile and Ratings Scores, adjusting weights based on the number of stays.

Output sitters.csv with columns: email, name, profile_score, ratings_score, search_score, sorted by Search Score descending.

Write tests to verify scoring calculations and sorting logic.

Include a README with setup instructions and a discussion on production implementation or infrastructure choices.
