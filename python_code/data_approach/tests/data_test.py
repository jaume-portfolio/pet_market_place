"""
Analytical/Data Approach Testing Notes:

Due to time constraints, testing focuses on the backend part
In a full-scale implementation, tests would include:

- Primary Key / Uniqueness: ensure identifiers (e.g., email) are unique.
- Not Null Values: mandatory fields (e.g., email, name) are present.
- Field Format Validation: proper phone number, email formats.
- Accepted Value Ranges: numeric fields like 'rating' within allowed bounds.
- Freshness / Timeliness: data is up-to-date.
- Consistency : Not needed in this case
- Integrity Across Relationships: Not needed in this case.
